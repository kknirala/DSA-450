// Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
// You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

// You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

// Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.
// -----------Example-------------------
// Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
// Output: 5
// Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
// Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

// my explanation:-> find the index of min value in array, and then find the greatest number after the losted value index.
// let arr = [7,1,5,3,6,4];
let arr = [7,6,4,3,1];
let lowerIndex = -1;
let lowerValue = arr[0];
let maxVal = Number.MIN_VALUE;

function maxProfit(){
   for(let i=1;i<arr.length;i++){
       if(lowerValue>arr[i]) 
       {
           lowerValue=arr[i];
           lowerIndex = i;
       }
   }
   for(let i = lowerIndex;i<arr.length;i++){
       if(arr[i]>maxVal) maxVal=arr[i]
   }
   console.log("Profit:-> ",maxVal-arr[lowerIndex]);
